    The process of creating this page was harder than I expected. I was originally attempting to make a anime finder. However due to varous complications and confusion I changed over to a gif finder. I used several stack exchange posts, w3schools tutorials, and  youtube videos as an example to create all of the code for this asignment. The only external image I used was a cropped version of the gif found here https://media.giphy.com/media/VlodMCPrAkqeQ/giphy.gif. Some special features are the hover to show title, copy link button, original source info, fixed back and next buttons for page management, a trending tab, and a fixed top button to quickly bring the used back to the top of the page. For API i would give myslef a 7.5, for localstorage I would give myself an 2.5, for controls I would give myself a 10, for error free I would give myself a 7.5 because while I bellive I got most of the errors I might be wrong, for code I would give myself a 7.5 because while the code is neatly formatted it does lack some comments, for semantic structure I would give myself a 4, for valid html I would give myself a 3, for valid css I would give myself a 4, for visual design I would give myself a 6, for interaction design I would give myslef a 8, for responsive I would give myself a 6, for checkpoints I would give myself a 4, for documentaion I would give myself a 6.
